## CI/CD leraning tutorial

**Overview**: The course, focuses on Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) techniques specifically for Machine Learning (ML).
**SDLC Overview**:
SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) involves stages like building, testing, and deploying software.
**SDLC in Machine Learning**:
ML workflows require data and model versioning and comprehensive testing across the ML pipeline.
ML development has unique challenges, including ongoing data updates and data engineering needs.
**Build**: Converts source code to executable code.
**Test**: Validates functionality and quality.
**Deploy**: Makes software available for use.
**SDLC in Machine Learning**:
ML development has unique challenges, including ongoing data updates and data engineering needs.
CI/CD integration in ML helps streamline development, accelerate iteration, and enable rapid prototyping and testing.
## CI/CD Concepts:
**Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automates building and testing code changes in a shared repository to avoid integration issues.
**Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Automates delivery of code changes to production with manual approvals.
**Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Extends Continuous Delivery by fully automating deployments.
**CI/CD in Machine Learning:**
ML workflows require data and model versioning and comprehensive testing across the ML pipeline.
Unique ML needs include tracking experiments, managing model infrastructure, and monitoring model performance.
CI/CD in ML also addresses the complexities of model reproducibility, pipeline testing, and streamlined deployment.
**Scope**: Covers data preparation, versioning, model development, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning within CI/CD frameworks.
**Summary**: Highlights the benefits of CI/CD in ML, including automation, reproducibility, enhanced testing, and efficient, reliable deployment.
