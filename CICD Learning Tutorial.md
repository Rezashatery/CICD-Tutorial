## CI/CD leraning tutorial

**Overview**: The course, focuses on Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) techniques specifically for Machine Learning (ML).
**SDLC Overview**:
SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) involves stages like building, testing, and deploying software.
**SDLC in Machine Learning**:
ML workflows require data and model versioning and comprehensive testing across the ML pipeline.
ML development has unique challenges, including ongoing data updates and data engineering needs.
**Build**: Converts source code to executable code.
**Test**: Validates functionality and quality.
**Deploy**: Makes software available for use.
**SDLC in Machine Learning**:
ML development has unique challenges, including ongoing data updates and data engineering needs.
CI/CD integration in ML helps streamline development, accelerate iteration, and enable rapid prototyping and testing.
### CI/CD Concepts:
**Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automates building and testing code changes in a shared repository to avoid integration issues.
**Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Automates delivery of code changes to production with manual approvals.
**Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Extends Continuous Delivery by fully automating deployments.
**CI/CD in Machine Learning:**
ML workflows require data and model versioning and comprehensive testing across the ML pipeline.
Unique ML needs include tracking experiments, managing model infrastructure, and monitoring model performance.
CI/CD in ML also addresses the complexities of model reproducibility, pipeline testing, and streamlined deployment.
**Scope**: Covers data preparation, versioning, model development, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning within CI/CD frameworks.
**Summary**: Highlights the benefits of CI/CD in ML, including automation, reproducibility, enhanced testing, and efficient, reliable deployment.

## Introduction to YAML:
YAML is a human-readable data format used widely for configuration files, data exchange, and structuring data in applications.
It provides an alternative to XML and is similar in function to JSON, aiming to facilitate interoperability across languages and applications.
YAML files use .yaml or .yml extensions and are heavily utilized in CI/CD tools, such as GitHub Actions and Data Version Control, to define workflows.
**YAML Syntax:**
YAML relies on consistent indentation (using spaces, not tabs) and line separation to organize data hierarchies.
Incorrect indentation leads to syntax errors, so using YAML validation tools is recommended.
Comments start with #.
**YAML Scalars:**
Scalars in YAML include data types like strings, numbers, booleans, and null values.
Boolean values are true or false without quotes, and null is represented by null or ~.
Strings can be unquoted, single-quoted, or double-quoted.
**YAML Collections:**
Collections consist of sequences (ordered lists) and mappings (key-value pairs).
Sequences are written in block style (with hyphens) or flow style (within brackets).
Mappings use a key-value structure, represented by a colon and can contain various data types.
Summary:
YAML is essential for CI/CD configuration, especially in ML applications, due to its readability and structure.
YAML relies on mappings, sequences, and scalars for data organization.
**Editor Exercises Layout:**
The editor layout includes folders (pink box), open files (blue box), and a terminal for bash commands (green box).
